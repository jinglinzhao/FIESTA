 FourIEr phase SepcTrum Analysis - linear model

A line profile is interpreted as shifted if all its frequency modes are shifted by the same amount; a line profile is interpreted as deformed if the composing frequency modes are shifted variously. 

In this demo, we show linear relations among shifts measured from different parts of the differential phase spectrum.
